# Fake_news_prediction

We developed a fake news prediction model using NLP. In order to find the model with the best accuracy to be implemented we tested 3 different ones Linear SVC, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logist Regression. 
The model with the best accuracy results is the Linear SVC therefore it was implemented. The Linear SVC gave a accuracy score around 99%.
To assure that the model was not being overfitted we analysed the training accuracy against the test accuracy. The conclusion of the analyses is that the model is not being overtitted.
